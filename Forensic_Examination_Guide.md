### Unit 2: Brain Fingerprinting

**Question 1 (15 marks):**
"Discuss the landmark Supreme Court judgment in Selvi v. State of Karnataka (2010) regarding brain fingerprinting, polygraph, and narcoanalysis tests.

### Unit 4: Bloodstain Pattern Analysis

**Question 1 (15 marks):**
"A bloodstain at a crime scene has measurements: length = 3 cm, width of tail = 1.5 cm, distance from convergence point = 2.5 meters. Calculate the impact angle and area of origin height. Explain what these measurements tell about the crime scene reconstruction."

**Answer Guidelines:**
- Calculate: sin(θ) = width/length = 1.5/3 = 0.5
- Therefore: θ = 30° (shallow angle)
- Calculate height: h = d × tan(θ) = 2.5 × tan(30°) = 2.5 × 0.577 = 1.44 meters
- Interpretation: Blood originated from point 2.5 m from convergence and 1.44 m above surface
- This height suggests victim was standing when injured (approximately waist to chest height for average person)
- Shallow 30° angle suggests high-force impact with victim horizontal or perpendicular to surface
- Multiple stains analyzed together provide 3D spatial reconstruction

**Question 2 (10 marks):**
"Explain how void patterns in bloodstain evidence can indicate object placement and victim position during the crime."

**Answer Guidelines:**
- Void is absence of blood due to object blocking spray
- Void shape and size corresponds to blocking object
- Void location relative to other patterns indicates object position
- Compare void with potential objects at scene
- Partial void indicates object movement during impact
- Void on wall may indicate victim position relative to wall
- Multiple voids from different impact sites indicate sequence of events
- Absence of expected void pattern indicates object moved post-event
