# UNIT 2: TYPES OF FINGERPRINTS - COMPREHENSIVE STUDY NOTES

---

## 1. TYPES OF FINGERPRINTS

### Definition and Overview
• **Fingerprints** are unique ridge patterns found on the friction ridges of fingers, palms, toes, and feet[19]
• These patterns are formed during fetal development (between 8-24 weeks of gestation) and remain unchanged throughout life[15][19]
• **No two fingerprints are identical**, even among monozygotic (identical) twins[19][29]
• Fingerprints consist of alternating ridges (raised portions) and furrows (recessed portions)[29]
• The permanence and uniqueness of fingerprints make them invaluable for forensic identification[28]

### Classification Basis
• Fingerprints are classified based on the **overall ridge pattern** they form[19][28]
• Three fundamental principles govern fingerprint identification:[28]
  - **Principle 1 (Individuality)**: Each person's fingerprints are unique and individual
  - **Principle 2 (Permanence/Persistence)**: Fingerprints do not change throughout a person's lifetime
  - **Principle 3 (Classifiability)**: Fingerprint patterns can be systematically classified and organized

### Main Categories
• The primary fingerprint patterns are classified into **THREE MAIN TYPES**:[16][29]
  1. **LOOPS** - approximately 60% of all patterns[29]
  2. **WHORLS** - approximately 35% of all patterns[16]
  3. **ARCHES** - approximately 5% of all patterns[16]
• Each main type has distinctive characteristics based on ridge flow direction and formation[38]

## 2. TYPES OF FINGERPRINT PATTERNS

### A. LOOPS (Approximately 60% of Population)

#### General Characteristics
• **Definition**: Loops are patterns in which one or more ridges enter from one side, recurve, and exit from the same side[48]
• Loops have **ONE CORE and ONE DELTA**[16][39]
• The pattern area is enclosed by type lines that form a valley-like structure[48]
• Ridge flow demonstrates a distinctive directional pattern toward either the radial (thumb) or ulnar (pinky) bone[38]

#### Types of Loops

##### A1. RADIAL LOOPS
• **Definition**: Ridge patterns that flow toward the radius bone (thumb side of the forearm)[38]
• **Percentage**: Constitute approximately 65% of all loop patterns[15][48]
• **Characteristics**:[48]
  - Ridges enter and exit on the thumb side
  - Pattern shows the distinctive downward slope in the direction of the thumb
  - More prevalent on the left hand
  - Pattern forms through smooth, continuous ridge formation

##### A1a. Plain Radial Loops
• **Appearance**: Ridges flow smoothly from one side to the other, forming a rounded and continuous loop[15]
• **Ridge Pattern**: Shows gentle, consistent curvature without angular formations[15]
• **Commonality**: Most prevalent type among radial loops[15]
• **Location**: Often found on index fingers and thumbs[15]
• **Ridge Count**: Determined by counting ridges between core and delta[27]

##### A1b. Tented Radial Loops
• **Appearance**: Features a more pointed or tent-like center compared to plain radial loops[15]
• **Distinguishing Feature**: The ridge at the center rises sharply, creating an angular peak[15]
• **Formation**: Distinct ridge pattern that differentiates from plain radial loops[15]
• **Frequency**: Less common than plain radial loops but equally unique[15]
• **Forensic Use**: Provides distinctive identification characteristics[15]

##### A2. ULNAR LOOPS
• **Definition**: Ridge patterns that flow toward the ulna bone (pinky finger side of the forearm)[19][38]
• **Percentage**: Most common fingerprint pattern, present in about 60% of individuals[19]

  - Ridges curve inward toward the little finger
  - Ridge flow follows the direction of the ulna bone
  - Ridges enter and exit on the same side of the finger (pinky side)
  - Forms a loop that flows toward the pinky
  - More common on the right hand[15]

##### A2a. Handedness Preference
• Ulnar loops show a marked preference for right-hand occurrence[15]
• This handedness pattern is notable in fingerprint development and genetics[15]
• The asymmetry provides additional forensic identification value[15]

##### A2b. Plain vs. Tented Variations
• **Plain Ulnar Loops**: Exhibit smooth ridge flow with rounded curvature[50]
• **Variations**: Can display different patterns within the ulnar loop category[15]

## 3. FINGERPRINT PATTERN AREA

### Definition
• **Pattern Area**: The portion of the fingerprint enclosed by the type lines[48]
• The area containing the core, delta, and ridges responsible for pattern determination[48]
• Represents the central, most important region for fingerprint classification[39]

### Boundaries of Pattern Area
• **Type Lines**: Two ridges that form the boundaries of the pattern area[39]
• **Location**: Type lines run along the outer edges of the pattern formation[48]
• **Function**: Clearly delineate the pattern area from the rest of the fingerprint[48]
• **Importance**: Essential for accurate pattern identification and classification[39]

### Components Within Pattern Area

---

## 5. CORE

### Definition
• **Core**: The innermost structure or central area of a fingerprint pattern[39]
• Often referred to as the approximate central point or center line(s) of the fingerprint impression[39]
• Represents the landmark of ridge counting[28]

### Characteristics
• **Location**: At or near the center of the fingerprint pattern[39]
• **Number**: Different patterns contain different numbers of cores:
  - Loops: ONE core[16][39]
  - Whorls: May have ONE or TWO cores (especially in double loops)[39]
  - Arches: May or may not have a clearly defined core[39]

### Types of Core Formations
• **Single Core**: Found in loops and most simple patterns[39]
• **Double Core**: Found in double loop whorls and some complex patterns[49]

• Used as reference point in ridge counting method[27]
• Starting point for ridge tracing analysis[26]
• Critical for pattern identification and classification[28]

### Significance in Classification Systems
• Core location and number differentiate between pattern types[28]
• Core centrality affects classification accuracy[47]
• Position of core relative to deltas determines pattern type[39]

---

## 6. DELTA

### Definition
• **Delta**: A triangular or funnel-shaped point or area within a fingerprint[16][39]
• Located within a three-pronged or funnel-shaped ridge structure[39]
• The ridge point nearest to where two parallel ridge lines (type lines) diverge[39]

### Characteristics
• **Shape**: Triangular or funnel-shaped formation[39]
• **Number per Pattern Type**:[39]
  - Loops: ONE delta[16][39]
  - Whorls: TWO or more deltas[16][39]
  - Arches: NO delta (or not clearly defined)[39]
• **Position**: Located toward the outer edge of the pattern area[39]

### Delta Features
• The point where ridge formation changes direction[16]
• Often appears as a distinct angular point in ridge pattern[16]
• Marks the boundary between the pattern area and the marginal area[39]
• Essential for ridge counting procedures[27]

### Functions
• Starting point for ridge counting in loop patterns[27]
• Reference point for ridge tracing in whorl patterns[26]

## 7. FINGERPRINT CHARACTERISTICS/MINUTIAE

### Definition and Overview
• **Minutiae** (or Minutiae Points): Ridge characteristics or distinctive points where ridge lines end or fork[17]
• Also known as **Galton Details** or **Ridge Characteristics**[17]
• Tiny, specific details within the fingerprint ridge pattern that make each fingerprint unique[17]
• Specific points used for fingerprint identification and authentication[17]

### Principle of Minutiae
• **Characteristic Minutiae**: Random minutiae that occur at arbitrary locations in fingerprints[17]
• **Necessary Minutiae**: Minutiae that result from geometric necessity (ridge divergence and frequency changes)[17]
• Combination of necessary and characteristic minutiae provides fingerprint individuality[17]
• Research indicates approximately **rule of thumb: out of 7 minutiae, 5 are necessary and 2 are random**[17]

### Primary Minutiae Types

#### Type 1: RIDGE ENDING (Ridge Termination)
• **Definition**: A point where a single ridge ends abruptly[40]
• **Appearance**: Ridge line terminates and does not continue[40]
• **Frequency**: One of the most common minutiae types[40]
• **Identification**: Ridge ends completely without bifurcation or merging[29]
• **Forensic Value**: Highly distinctive and used in fingerprint matching[29]
• **Characteristics**: Clear termination point visible under magnification[40]

#### Type 2: RIDGE BIFURCATION
• **Definition**: A point where a single ridge divides into two ridges[40]
• **Structure**: Ridge splits into two separate ridge lines from a common point[40]
• **Direction**: The two ridges flow in different directions from the bifurcation point[40]
• **Frequency**: Occurs regularly in fingerprints and used in matching[40]
• **Identification Value**: Distinctive pattern for fingerprint comparison[29]
• **Appearance**: Looks like a "Y" or fork in the ridge[40]

### Secondary/Additional Minutiae Types

#### Other Important Characteristics[40]
• **Short Ridges/Independent Ridges**: Ridge commences, travels a short distance, then ends
• **Ridge Enclosure (Loop/Enclosure)**: A single ridge bifurcates and reunites shortly afterward, continuing as a single ridge
• **Spur**: A bifurcation with a short ridge branching off a longer ridge
• **Crossover/Bridge**: A short ridge running between two parallel ridges
• **Dot/Island**: Isolated ridge fragments appearing as small dots or islands
• **Ridge Ending at Bifurcation**: Complex pattern where bifurcation immediately follows ridge ending

### Properties of Minutiae[17]
Each minutiae point is represented by specific properties:
• **Location**: X and Y coordinates of the minutiae point
• **Orientation**: Direction angle of the ridge at that point
• **Type**: Classification as ending, bifurcation, or other characteristic

### Matching Process Using Minutiae[29]
• Forensic examiners compare minutiae between suspect prints and known prints:
  - First gather known prints with same general pattern type
  - Using magnification tools, compare specific minutiae details
  - If sufficient minutiae details correlate, prints are from same person[29]

### Statistical Distribution of Minutiae[17]
• Average of **0.50 total minutiae per patch** (research-based)
• Random minutiae constitute approximately 0.14 per patch
• Fingerprints at 500 dpi resolution show consistent minutiae distribution patterns[17]

## 8. PLAIN AND ROLLED FINGERPRINTS

### A. DEFINITION AND DISTINCTION

#### Plain Fingerprints
• **Definition**: A fingerprint impression taken by pressing the finger flat down on paper or digital surface[28]
• **Method**: Finger is placed with its entire pad making contact with the recording surface[28]
• **Pressure**: Applied straight down without rolling motion[28]
• **Contact Area**: Generally shows less area of the fingertip than rolled prints[47]

#### Rolled Fingerprints
• **Definition**: A fingerprint impression taken by rolling the finger from one side to the other across the recording surface[28]
• **Method**: Finger is rolled from the outer edge (pinky side) to the inner edge (thumb side)[28]
• **Coverage**: Records the maximum surface area of the fingertip[28]
• **Technique**: Requires careful rolling motion to capture complete ridge pattern[28]

### B. COLLECTION TECHNIQUE IN FORENSIC PRACTICE

#### Sequence for Taking Fingerprints
• **Step 1**: Rolled impressions are recorded first:
  - Right hand fingers in sequence: thumb, index, middle, ring, little finger[28]
  - Immediately below: left hand fingers in same order[28]
  
• **Step 2**: Plain impressions recorded at bottom:
  - Index, middle, and ring fingers of both hands[28]
  - Taken for additional reference and comparison[28]
  - Sometimes called "slap prints"[28]

### C. CHARACTERISTICS AND ADVANTAGES

#### Rolled Fingerprints
• **Advantages**:[28]
  - Capture maximum surface area of the fingertip
  - Show more ridge detail and minutiae
  - Contain more area for ridge counting and tracing
  - Primary method for forensic databases and classification
  - Provide maximum information for fingerprint matching

• **Pattern Visibility**: Better visibility of pattern characteristics
• **Detail Quality**: Superior resolution of ridge details[28]
• **Minutiae Count**: Generally contain more identifiable minutiae[28]

#### Plain Fingerprints
• **Advantages**:[28]
  - Additional verification and comparison data
  - Quick reference for pattern type identification
  - Useful for initial screening and exclusion
  - Important for establishing proper contact and pressure
  - Provide alternative viewing angles

• **Use in Analysis**: Supplement rolled prints in verification process[28]
• **Forensic Value**: Secondary but important documentation[28]

### D. FINGERPRINT QUALITY AND ANALYSIS

#### Factors Affecting Print Quality
• **Pressure Application**: Inconsistent pressure produces poor-quality prints[47]
• **Surface Contamination**: Dirt, oil, or foreign material affects image clarity[25]
• **Finger Positioning**: Improper positioning results in incomplete impressions[47]
• **Rolling Completeness**: Incomplete rolling misses critical ridge areas[47]

#### Incomplete Rolling Issues
• Research shows that incomplete rolling during acquisition can occur[47]
• Affects the accurate representation of core location and pattern[47]
• May lead to misclassification if not corrected[47]

## 9. RIDGE COUNTING

### A. DEFINITION AND PURPOSE

#### General Definition
• **Ridge Counting**: A technique that involves counting the intervening ridges between the core and delta of a fingerprint[27]
• Quantifies the ridges between these two reference points[27]
• Helps categorize fingerprints based on their ridge counts[27]

#### Objectives of Ridge Counting[27]
• **Primary Objective 1**: Classification - enhance classification process by differentiating between similar patterns
• **Primary Objective 2**: Efficiency - make fingerprint identification systems more efficient and less time-consuming

#### Application in Classification
• Ridge counting is **mainly used for loop patterns**[27]
• For **arches**, ridge counting is generally not applicable[27]
• For **whorls**, ridge tracing is often used instead[27]

### B. APPLICABILITY BY PATTERN TYPE

#### Ridge Counting for Different Patterns[27]
• **Loops**: Primary pattern for ridge counting
  - Used in all loop pattern classifications
  - Essential for determining sub-classifications

• **Arches**: Generally NO ridge counting
  - Arches typically have a zero ridge count
  - They lack a delta, making ridge counting not applicable

• **Whorls**: Ridge counting used in specific circumstances
  - Applied when whorl patterns appear in specific finger positions
  - Final classification stage uses ridge counting for little fingers
  - Ridge counting employed when whorl patterns present in little fingers[27]

### C. RULES OF RIDGE COUNTING FOR LOOPS

#### The Ten Rules of Ridge Counting[27]

##### Rule 1: Choosing Core and Delta
• Locate the fingerprint with a clear loop pattern containing one core and one delta[27]
• Ensure the core and delta are clearly visible and distinct[27]
• Verify the pattern type before proceeding[27]

##### Rule 2: Imaginary Straight Line
• Once core and delta are located, draw an imaginary straight line between them[27]
• Use a ruler or straight edge to mark the line[27]
• The line should be straight, not curved[27]

##### Rule 3: NOT Including Core and Delta Ridges
• **Critical Rule**: The core and delta are NEVER included in ridge counting[27]
• Counting must be done ONLY of the intervening ridges[27]
• Begin counting from the ridge immediately adjacent to delta[27]
• End counting at the ridge immediately adjacent to core[27]

##### Rule 4: Counting Intervening Ridges
• Count only the ridges between the core and delta[27]
• Ridges should cross or intersect the imaginary line[27]
• Each ridge crossing counts as ONE ridge[27]

##### Rule 5: When Ridges End Abruptly
• If a ridge ends abruptly while passing through the imaginary line[27]
• That point is considered as **ONE ridge count**[27]
• The ending ridge still counts toward total[27]

##### Rule 6: When Long and Short Ridges Appear
• When loop patterns have long or short ridges[27]
• Their values should always be counted as **ONE for each**[27]
• Ridge length does not affect the count[27]

##### Rule 7: When Dot or Island Patterns Appear
• When in-between ridges have a dot or island pattern[27]
• The ridge count value for each will be **ONE**[27]
• Small ridge fragments count as individual ridges[27]

##### Rule 8: When Bifurcation Pattern Appears
• In presence of bifurcation or initial arising of bifurcation[27]
• It is counted as **TWO ridge counts**[27]
• The fork point is treated as creating two ridges[27]

##### Rule 9: When Two Ridges Meet or Cross Over
• If there is a meeting or crossing over of two ridges[27]
• It is considered as **TWO ridge counts**[27]
• Each crossing creates countable ridge interactions[27]

##### Rule 10: When Ridge Enclosure Appears
• If there is any ridge enclosure (anastomosis) or its initial formation[27]
• They are valued as **TWO ridges** [27]
• Count values to be **TWO**[27]

### D. RIDGE COUNTING PROCEDURE - PRACTICAL STEPS

#### Step 1: Getting Ready[27]
• Find loop patterns in fingerprint
• Use fingerprint ink pad and mark the finger ridge over A4 size paper
• Ensure clear impression with good visibility

#### Step 2: Locate Core and Delta[27]
• In inked fingerprint of loop pattern, locate exact position of delta
• Locate exact position of core
• Verify both are clearly visible

#### Step 3: Draw Imaginary Line[27]
• Draw imaginary straight line between core and delta
• Use ruler/transparent scale for accuracy
• Ensure line is perfectly straight

#### Step 4: Do NOT Count Core and Delta[27]
• Do NOT include the ridge of core in count
• Do NOT include the ridge of delta in count
• Begin counting from first ridge after delta
• End counting at last ridge before core

#### Step 5: Count Intervening Ridges[27]
• Count ridges according to ridge counting rules
• Apply special rules for bifurcations, enclosures, etc.
• Trace line from delta to core
• Total ridge count = sum of all intervening ridges

### E. RIDGE COUNTING IN DIFFERENT FINGER POSITIONS

#### Ridge Counting for Different Fingers[27]
• **Right Little Finger**: Preferred for ridge counting[27]
• **Left Little Finger**: Used if right little finger has no loop[27]
• **When Both Have Whorls**: Whorls are used instead for classification[27]

#### Guidelines for Ridge Counts in Classification[27]
• **Index Finger Ridge Counting**:
  - 9 or less = I (Inner)
  - More than 9 = O (Outer)

• **Middle and Ring Finger**:
  - 10 or less = I (Inner)
  - More than 10 = O (Outer)

• **Little Finger**: Used for final classification[27][28]

### F. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF RIDGE COUNTING

#### Example 1: Simple Loop Pattern
• Core clearly marked with vertical line[27]
• Delta located with triangular formation[27]
• Imaginary line drawn between them[27]
• **Total Ridge Count = 17** (in given example)[27]

#### Example 2: Loop with Special Features
• Include bifurcations counted as TWO[27]
• Include ridge endings counted as ONE[27]
• Include enclosures counted as TWO[27]
• **Final Count = 11** (in different example)[27]

## 10. RIDGE TRACING

### A. DEFINITION AND PURPOSE

#### General Definition
• **Ridge Tracing**: Method of following a single ridge from the left delta to determine pattern characteristics[26]
• Used to classify and differentiate whorl patterns[26]
• Traces a continuous ridge line from one reference point to another[26]

#### Primary Application
• **Primary Use**: Ridge tracing is the major classification method for whorl patterns[26][28]
• Applied when fingerprint consists of all whorls or composite whorls[26]
• Used specifically in sub-classification of whorls[26]

#### Objectives of Ridge Tracing[26]
• Differentiate between different whorl sub-classifications[26]
• Determine if whorl is inner, outer, or meeting type[26]
• Narrow down classification groups for filing and searching[28]

### B. RIDGE TRACING METHOD

#### Basic Procedure
• **Step 1**: Identify whorl pattern[26]
• **Step 2**: Locate left delta and right delta in whorl[26]
• **Step 3**: Select a ridge at/near the left delta[26]
• **Step 4**: Trace that single ridge from left delta[26]
• **Step 5**: Follow the ridge to determine its relationship with right delta[26]

#### Ridge Selection for Tracing
• The ridge chosen should:
  - Begin near or at the left delta[26]
  - Be clearly continuous[26]
  - Be easily followable across the pattern[26]
  - Allow determination of relationship to right delta[26]

### C. WHORL CLASSIFICATION BY RIDGE TRACING

#### Types of Whorls Determined by Ridge Tracing[26][28]

##### Type 1: INNER WHORL (I)
• The traced ridge ends **INSIDE** the other delta[26]
• The ridge path passes on the inner side of the right delta[26]
• Most restrictive path classification[26]

##### Type 2: MEETING WHORL (M)
• The traced ridge **MEETS** or **TOUCHES** the right delta line[26]
• The ridge path intersects directly with the delta point[26]
• Intermediate classification between inner and outer[26]

##### Type 3: OUTER WHORL (O)
• The traced ridge ends **OUTSIDE** the other delta[26]
• The ridge path passes on the outer side of the right delta[26]
• Most expansive path classification[26]

### D. RULES FOR ACCURATE RIDGE TRACING

#### Careful Tracing Requirements[26][28]
• Ridge tracing requires high accuracy and attention to detail[26]
• **Special care must be taken when whorls have symmetrically disposed deltas**[28]
• When deltas are symmetrically placed, ridge path must be carefully traced[28]
• Mistakes in tracing lead to misclassification[28]

#### Sub-Classification by Ridge Tracing[26][28]
• When all slips contain only whorls/composites, ridge tracing is applied[28]
• A whorl may be classified as:
  - Inner whorl
  - Outer whorl
  - Meeting whorl

• Index and middle finger combinations create classification structure[28]
• Each finger pair can be I, M, or O = 3 × 3 = 9 combinations per hand[28]
• Both hands combined = 9 × 9 = 81 total classification groups[28]

### E. FORENSIC SIGNIFICANCE

#### Advantages of Ridge Tracing Classification[26][28]
• Allows discrimination between central pockets, lateral pockets, twinned loops, and accidentals[28]
• Facilitates faster classification when dealing with whorl patterns[28]
• Provides systematic method for filing and searching large databases[28]

#### Application in Henry's Classification System[28]
• Ridge tracing is used in primary classification when appropriate[28]
• Applied specifically to accumulations under certain primary classifications[28]
• Reduces search time significantly in forensic database systems[28]

• **Total Classifications**: 1024 primary classification groups[28]

### Six Main Classifications[41]

#### 1. Primary Classification[41]
• Considers patterns in all ten fingers[41]
• Whorls receive numerical values[41]
• Loops receive no numerical values[41]
• Creates 1024 classification groups[28]

#### 2. Major Classification[41]
• Based on patterns in thumbs only[41]
• Uses ridge count or ridge trace values[41]
• Right thumb value in numerator, left in denominator[41]

#### 3. Secondary Classification[41]
• Based on index finger patterns[41]
• Pattern type designated by capital letters[41]
• Right index in numerator, left index in denominator[41]

#### 4. Sub-Secondary Classification[41]
• Patterns of index, middle, and ring fingers[41]
• Uses ridge counting or ridge tracing values[41]
• Designated by letters I, M, O[41]

#### 5. Final Classification[41]
• Based on ridge count of little fingers[41]
• Uses loop patterns (rarely whorls)[41]
• Provides ultimate specificity within groups[41]

#### 6. Key Classification[41]
• Based on first loop count excluding little finger[41]
• Provides alternative subdivision method[41]

## SUMMARY AND KEY POINTS

### Remember These Critical Points:
1. **Uniqueness**: No two people have identical fingerprints[19][29]
2. **Permanence**: Fingerprints remain unchanged throughout life[19][29]
3. **Classifiability**: Patterns can be systematically categorized[28]
4. **Three Main Types**: Loops (60%), Whorls (35%), Arches (5%)[28]
5. **Minutiae**: Specific ridge characteristics used for matching[17][29]
6. **Ridge Counting**: For loops to differentiate similar patterns[27]
7. **Ridge Tracing**: For whorls to classify sub-types[26][28]
8. **Rolled Prints**: Capture maximum ridge detail for analysis[28]
9. **Henry System**: Universal classification method with 1024 groups[28]
10. **Forensic Value**: Fingerprints remain most reliable identification method[29]
